    "In a simplified sense, embeddings map a word or phrase into n-dimensional space with a dense continuous vector, where each dimension in the vector represents some \"latent feature\" of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is best represented in a classic example:\n",
    "<div>\n",

    "\n",
    "The relationship of \"puppy -> dog\" reflects the same relationship as \"baby -> adult\", but dogs are (typically) hairier than humans. However, adults typically have more hair than babies - so they are shifted slightly closer to dogs on the X_2 axis!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is a simplified and contrived example - but it is *essentially* the mechanism by which embeddings capture semantic information.\n",

    "In reality, the dimensions don't sincerely represent hard-concepts like \"age\" or \"hair\", but it's useful as a way to think about how the semantic relationships are captured.\n",
